# Education

- 2010-2014: I received my Bachelor's Degree in physics from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) in 2014, at the foothils of [Luojia mountain](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/珞珈山).  My undergraduate thesis was    advised by [Dr Eugene Lim](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/eugene-lim) while being an exchange student at  [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/)  for the 2013 academic year with financial support from [CSC](https://www.csc.edu.cn/). Before that, I was an undergraduate researcher in [Prof. Zhijie Tan](http://physics.whu.edu.cn/info/1052/2105.htm)'s group.
- 2014-2020: I obtained my PhD in physics in the [department of physics](https://w3.physics.arizona.edu/) at [University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/), advised by Prof. [Charles Wolgemuth](http://www.physics.arizona.edu/~wolg/). My research is to combine mathematical and computational techniques with physical principles to understand the most mysterious phenomenon in this universe --- life. More specifically, my research focuses on understanding shape dynamics of vesicles. In particular, I am deriving partial differential equations (PDEs) governing shape dynamics of biomembranes and developing massively parallel three dimensional numerical schemes to solve those PDEs. I am also working on designing novel numerical algorithms for applications in computational physics and image processing in general.

# Work Experience

*   Sep 2020 - Jun 2023: Software development engineer at  [Glodon](https://www.glodon.com/en/). My primary responsibility is to solve geometrical problems in an industrial environment with mathematical and computational skills.

*   Jun 2023 - Now : Senior Researcher at Shanghai Xindi. Here I am adding feature commands to our CAD software.
