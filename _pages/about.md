- I am currently a PhD candidate in the [department of physics](https://w3.physics.arizona.edu/) at [University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/), advised by Prof. [Charles Wolgemuth](http://www.physics.arizona.edu/~wolg/).
- My interests range cross many fields of knowledge, including but not limited to physics, mathematics, philosophy, psychology, biology, history, economics, arts, social science etc. All of those fileds help us understand ourselves and this world. Life, sadly, is too short for one to dip into any of them.
- My research interest is to combine mathematical and computational techniques with physical principles to understand the most mysterious phenomenon in this universe --- life.
- I am interested in applying computational and mathematical techniques to solve problems at the interface of physics and biology from molecular level to celluar levels.
