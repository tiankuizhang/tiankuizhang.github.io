## Abstract
Cell membranes are crucial to the life of cells and vesicles are important model systems for cell membranes. In this thesis, we aim to understand shape transformation of vesicles with theoretical tools from differential geometry and numerical techniques within the framework of level set method.
In Chapter 1, a breify introduction to membrane structure and membrane proteins is given. In Chapter 2, we introduce the mathemtical language for the description of surfaces and curves. In Chapter 3, variation for the Hamilton beyond Helfrich model is presented. In Chapter 4, we show how to discretize geometries of surface and curves with the level set method. A novel high order scheme for Hamilton-Jacobi equation with level set-defined boundary conditions is developed. In Chapter 5, we demonstrate accuray of our numerical scheme introduced in Chapter 4 with numerical experiments. In Chapter 6, we develop a semi-implicit level set method for the dynamics of single phase vesicles, biphasic vesicles and protine kinetics in three dimensional space. We explore how different parameters and physical conditions affect shape of vesicles.
